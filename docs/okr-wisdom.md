# OKR Wisdom: Quotations from the Experts

## Andy Grove - Father of OKRs (Intel CEO)

Andy Grove pioneered OKRs at Intel in the 1970s, using them to successfully transition Intel from a memory company to a microprocessor company.

### On the Core Purpose of OKRs

> "A successful system needs only to answer two questions:  
> Where do I want to go? **The answer provides the Objective.**  
> How will I pace myself to see if I'm getting there? **The answer gives us Key Results.**"

### On Focus

> "The one thing OKR provides par excellence is **focus**."

**Context**: Grove believed that successful execution requires intense concentration on a few critical goals, not spreading resources across many initiatives.

### On Alignment and Hierarchy

> "We see a nesting hierarchy of Objectives: if the subordinate's Objectives are met, the supervisor's Objectives will be met as well."

**Key Insight**: OKRs should cascade - individual goals support team goals, which support company goals.

### On Specificity

> "To be useful a Key Result must contain very specific wording and dates, so that when the deadline time arrives, there is no room for ambiguity."

**Takeaway**: Vague key results are useless. Use numbers and deadlines.

### On Performance Management

> "It [OKR] is not a legal document upon which to base a performance review, but should be just one input used to determine how well an individual is doing. If the supervisor mechanically relies on the system to evaluate performance, or if the subordinate rigidly forgoes emerging opportunities because they weren't specified Objectives, then both are behaving in a petty and unprofessional fashion."

**Critical Lesson**: OKRs are a tool for alignment and focus, NOT a performance evaluation formula. Stay flexible.

### On Execution

> "It almost doesn't matter what you know. It's **what you can do with whatever you know**."

**Philosophy**: Knowledge is worthless without execution. OKRs force execution.

## John Doerr - OKR Evangelist (Venture Capitalist, Kleiner Perkins)

John Doerr learned OKRs from Andy Grove at Intel and introduced them to Google in 1999. His book *"Measure What Matters"* popularized OKRs worldwide.

### On Ideas vs. Execution

> "**Ideas are easy. Execution is everything.**"  
> *(Quoting Andy Grove)*

**Implication**: OKRs bridge the gap between strategy and execution.

### On the Magic of Measurement

> "The magic words are **'as measured by.'**  
> If a Key Result isn't measurable, time-related, if I can't declare it done, then it doesn't have the kind of fidelity or integrity that it ought to."

**Template**: "I will [Objective] **as measured by** [Key Results]"

### On Stretch Goals

> "If you set a crazy, ambitious goal and miss it, you'll **still achieve something remarkable**."

**70% Rule**: Missing a stretch goal at 70% completion is better than hitting a conservative goal at 100%.

### On the Four Superpowers of OKRs

1. **Focus and Commit to Priorities**
   > "Focus is a matter of deciding what things you're NOT going to do."

2. **Align and Connect for Teamwork**
   > "By clearing the line of sight to everyone's objectives, OKRs save time and money."

3. **Track for Accountability**
   > "It's not a key result unless it has a number."

4. **Stretch for Amazing**
   > "There are many ways in which we can fall short, but there's only one way to win: you have to stretch."

### On Transparency

> "Transparency seeds collaboration."

**Practice**: Make all OKRs visible across the organization (with rare exceptions for confidential projects).

### On Continuous Recognition

> "Continuous recognition is a powerful driver of engagement."

**Application**: Celebrate progress towards OKRs, not just completion.

### On Deadlines

> "Nothing moves us forward like a deadline."

**Why it works**: Time-bound goals create urgency and prevent endless perfection-seeking.

### On Culture

> "Healthy culture and structured goal setting are interdependent."

**Insight**: You can't have great culture without clarity of goals, and you can't sustain OKRs without supportive culture.

### On OKRs as Social Contracts

> "Google uses OKR as a tool to empower people. People think it's about accountability, and it does achieve that as a byproduct. However, it's really a way to **build a social contract** in your organization."

**Meaning**: OKRs are fundamentally about alignment and trust, not command-and-control.

### On What vs. How

> "The Objectives are **what** you want to have accomplished.  
> The Key Results are **the 'how'** in 'how you're going to get that done.'  
> What matters more than getting the best single answer is getting the team to **agree** on how you're going to do what you set out to do."

**Collaboration**: OKRs force teams to discuss execution, build consensus.

### On Not Being a Silver Bullet

> "OKR is not a silver bullet; it's a powerful, clear, empowering **communications tool** to get transparency, some accountability, and a lot of enthusiasm about what it is that's really important."

**Realistic Expectations**: OKRs won't solve all problems. They're a framework, not magic.

### On Leadership Commitment

> "This system works provided the **leadership of the company embraces it**. If the CEO of the company doesn't believe in OKRs and won't pursue them, I suggest you not try.  
> If the leader of the organization sets personal OKRs as well as group OKRs, I daresay this is the **most powerful tool** you can have to achieve operating excellence and high performance."

**Critical Success Factor**: C-level buy-in is non-negotiable.

## Google's OKR Philosophy

From *"Software Engineering at Google"* by Fergus Henderson:

### On Scoring

> "OKRs should be set high: the desired target overall average score is **65%**, meaning that a team is encouraged to set as goals about 50% more tasks than they are likely to actually accomplish."

**Standard**: 65-70% achievement = excellent.

### On Performance Reviews

> "OKRs and OKR scores are normally made visible across Google (with occasional exceptions for especially sensitive information), but they are **NOT used directly as input** to an individual's performance appraisal."

**Critical Rule**: Never tie OKRs to compensation/bonuses.

### On Social Incentives

> "OKRs provide a key mechanism for communicating what each part of the company is working on, and for encouraging good performance from employees via **social incentives**.  
> Employees know that their team will have a meeting where the OKRs will be scored, and have a **natural drive** to try to score well, even though OKRs have no direct impact on performance appraisals or compensation."

**Human Nature**: People want to perform well publicly. OKRs harness this without financial incentives.

### On Measurability

> "Defining key results that are **objective and measurable** helps ensure that this human drive to perform well is channeled to doing things that have real concrete measurable impact on progress towards shared objectives."

**Alignment**: Measurable results ensure effort goes to what matters.

## Richard Rumelt - Strategy vs. Goals

From *"Good Strategy, Bad Strategy"*:

> "If you fail to identify and analyze the obstacles, **you don't have a strategy**.  
> Instead, you have either a stretch goal, a budget, or a list of things you wish would happen."

**Distinction**: OKRs are NOT strategy. They model your strategy. Must have Vision → Strategy → OKRs → Work.

---

## Ant Murphy - OKRs in Context

> "OKRs are a **model of your strategy**, not the strategy itself."

**Framework**: Vision → Strategy → OKRs → Roadmap → Work

> "Without a strategy, you would likely jump straight to building the Model 3 first and skip the Model S and Roadster. But that wasn't Elon's strategy for Tesla."

**Example**: OKRs must be grounded in strategic choices about *how* to achieve vision, not just *what.*

## Christina Wodtke (Elegant Hack) - Pre-Work

### On Capacity Planning

> "Research varies, but it appears that we only have **3-4 hours of true productivity** a day.  
> If we assume 2-3 hours of other work (meetings, emails, chatting), it becomes clear that most days are 6 hours and the rest productivity theater."

**Realistic Planning**: Count 6 productive hours/day when estimating OKR capacity.

### On Progressive Ambition

> "If people didn't even get close to the desired effect, choose gentle **'yoga stretch' goals** instead of moonshot goals.  
> If teams are achieving OKRs easily, then nudge them to aim 10% higher.  
> Never forget this is a **marathon, not a sprint**. Burning out your best performers is expensive (and depressing)."

**Sustainable Growth**: Gradually increase ambition. Don't burn out teams.

### On Celebrating Teams, Not Heroes

> "It's tempting to celebrate someone who has gone above and beyond, but a **culture of heroes can hurt** your company in the long run. Celebrate teams."

**Culture**: Team success > individual heroics.
