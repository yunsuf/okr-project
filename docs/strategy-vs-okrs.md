# Strategy vs. OKRs: Understanding the Difference

## The Critical Distinction

### What Most Companies Do Wrong ❌

```
Vision → OKRs → Work
```

**Problem**: OKRs alone don't explain:
- WHY this objective matters?
- WHAT is the strategy?
- WHY did you choose THIS objective over others?
- HOW does this connect to the vision?
- WHAT obstacles are in the way?

### What You Should Do ✅

```
Vision → Strategy → OKRs → Roadmap → Work
```

**Key Insight**: OKRs are a **MODEL of your strategy**, not the strategy itself.

## Real Example: Tesla

### Vision (2003-2013)
> "To accelerate the advent of sustainable transport by bringing compelling **mass market** electric cars to market as soon as possible."

### If You Had ONLY the Vision + OKR:

**OKR**: "Achieve CSAT of 9+ from Tesla customers"

**Confusion**: 
- Why are we building a high-end sports car (Tesla Roadster)?
- Vision says "mass market" but we're starting with luxury?
- Couldn't we achieve customer satisfaction with ANY car type?

### The Missing Piece: STRATEGY

**Elon's 4-Step Master Plan** (2006):
1. Build sports car
2. Use that money to build an affordable car
3. Use that money to build an even more affordable car
4. While doing above, also provide zero emission power generation

**NOW the OKR makes sense**:
- CSAT from Roadster customers → validates luxury EV market
- Funds from Roadster sales → finance Model S development
- Model S success → finance Model 3 (true mass market)

**Strategy explains** *why* we're starting with sports car, even though vision is mass market.

## Mistaking Goals for Strategy

> "If you fail to identify and analyze the obstacles, **you don't have a strategy**. Instead, you have either a stretch goal, a budget, or a list of things you wish would happen."  
> — Richard Rumelt, *Good Strategy Bad Strategy*

This is one of the **4 major hallmarks of bad strategy**.

### What is Strategy?

Strategy involves **choices**:
- To target THIS segment (not others)
- To pull THIS lever (OKR) over another
- To play in THIS field and NOT another
- To achieve THIS OKR first, THEN that one

**Most importantly**: All the choices to **NOT** do something.

## What Each Layer Answers

| Layer | Timeframe | Question | Example |
|-------|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Vision** | 10+ years | Where do we want to be? | "Mars colony" |
| **Mission** | Permanent | Why do we exist? | "Make life multi-planetary" |
| **Strategy** | 3-5 years | How do we get there? | "Start with luxury EVs → mass market" |
| **OKRs** | Quarterly | What progress this quarter? | "Achieve 99.9% uptime" |
| **Roadmap** | Monthly | What are we building? | "New cache layer, monitoring" |
| **Work** | Daily | What am I doing today? | "Write unit tests for API" |

## Common Mistake: Skipping Strategy

### Without Strategy:

**Vision**: "Be the leader in sustainable transport"  
**OKR**: "Sell 100,000 Model 3s this year"  
**Result**: ❌ Chaos

**Why?** No explanation of:
- Why Model 3, not mass market van?
- Why 100K, not 50K or 200K?
- What obstacles are we solving?
- What are we NOT doing?

### With Strategy:

**Vision**: "Be the leader in sustainable transport"  
**Strategy**: "Luxury first → mass market second (use luxury profits to subsidize R&D)"  
**OKR**: "Sell 100,000 Model 3s this year"  
**Result**: ✅ Aligned execution

**Now everyone understands**:
- Model S/Roadster success enables Model 3
- 100K target based on battery production capacity
- We're NOT doing trucks yet (wrong sequence)

## How OKRs and Strategy Interact

### OKRs are **Levers** That Execute Strategy

**Think of OKRs as**:
- The levers you pull to make progress
- Incremental measurement of strategy execution
- The "how we'll measure" part of strategic choices

**Example**:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Strategy** | "Win enterprise market by being most reliable" |
| **OKR Q1** | "Achieve 99.99% uptime" (lever: reliability) |
| **OKR Q2** | "Reduce MTTR from 45min to 15min" (lever: recovery speed) |
| **OKR Q3** | "Lower CFR from 12% to 5%" (lever: deploy safety) |

Each OKR is a **strategic bet** that this lever will move you toward the goal.

## Pre-Work Required Before Setting OKRs

**Don't jump straight to OKRs**. Do this first:

### 1. Clarify Mission & Vision
- **Mission**: Why do we exist?
- **Vision**: Where are we going?

OKRs must align with this overarching purpose.

### 2. Evolve Your Strategy
- Is our current strategy still relevant?
- What new market trends require adjustment?
- What obstacles must we overcome?

**Strategy shifts** determine OKR focus.

### 3. Understand Stakeholder Priorities
- **Customers**: What pain points?
- **Investors**: What growth targets?
- **Partners**: How can we collaborate?

OKRs should reflect their needs.

### 4. Set Timeframes & Resources
- Quarterly or annual OKRs?
- What budget do we have?
- **Realistic capacity**: 3-4 productive hours/day per person

> "If a person is 100% on a task, count them as 6 hours a week." - Christina Wodtke

### 5. Align Across Departments
- Hold cross-functional meetings
- Ensure team OKRs complement each other
- Identify dependencies

### 6. Review Past Performance
- What worked? What didn't?
- Were goals too ambitious or too easy?
- Did KRs deliver tangible outcomes?

**Adjust**:
- If teams missed badly → "yoga stretch" goals (gentler)
- If teams hit 100% easily → aim 10% higher

### 7. Involve Your Team in Brainstorming
- Early involvement = ownership
- Don't use traditional brainstorming (studies show it's ineffective)
- **Better**: Everyone brings insights from their role → synthesize → sleep on it

### 8. Establish Clear Guidelines
- What makes a good Objective? (Ambitious, achievable, time-bound)
- What makes a good KR? (Quantifiable, specific, linked to objective)
- **Focus**: 1-3 OKRs per timeframe

### 9. Establish Review & Feedback Processes
- Weekly check-ins
- Quarterly scoring
- **Define success**: Is it 100%? 70%? Agree upfront.
- **Celebrate teams**, not individual heroes

## Warning Signs You're Confusing Goals with Strategy

1. ✅ **You HAVE strategy if**: You can explain WHY this OKR, not another, and WHAT obstacles it solves
2. ❌ **You DON'T have strategy if**: OKRs are just a list of things you wish would happen

**Test**: Can a new team member read your OKRs and understand:
- Why these specific goals?
- Why now?
- Why this sequence?
- What are we NOT doing?

If NO → you need strategy, not just OKRs.

---

## Summary: Key Principles

1. **OKRs ≠ Strategy**: OKRs model your strategy
2. **Flow**: Vision → Strategy → OKRs → Roadmap → Work
3. **Strategy = Choices**: What to do AND what NOT to do
4. **OKRs = Levers**: Incremental progress measures
5. **Context is Critical**: Don't communicate OKRs in a vacuum
6. **Pre-Work Matters**: 1-2 days of strategy work before writing OKRs
7. **Progressive Ambition**: Gradually increase stretch over quarters
8. **This is a Marathon**: Don't burn out teams with unrealistic goals
